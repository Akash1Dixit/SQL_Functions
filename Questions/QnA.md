### Group By

The GROUP BY Statement in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups with the help of some functions. i.e if a particular column has same values in different rows then it will arrange these rows in a group.

Important Points:
 
* GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT statement.
* In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed after the WHERE clause.
* In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed before ORDER BY clause if used any
